I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Minnesota NLP group](https://minnesotanlp.github.io/) led by [Prof. Dongyeop Kang](https://dykang.github.io/) at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I am co-supervised by [Prof. Jaideep Srivastava](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Y4J5SOwAAAAJ&hl=en) who leads the Data Mining and Research Group ([DMR](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/data-science-and-machine-learning)) at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. I also work as a research assistant to [Prof. Jisu Huh](https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/jhuh), who heads the Minnesota Computational Advertising Laboratory ([MCAL](https://mcal.umn.edu/)).

Broadly, my research aims to combine NLP with computational social science.
Specifically, I am interested in learning about people — how user preferences, social cues, and contextual factors influence and drive user behavior — in online social media settings. I am also interested in exploring the stylistic analysis of user text content. I have adopted a variety of deep learning, natural language processing, graph, and statistical methods towards my interest in Computational Social Science.
 
I obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and my Bachelor's degree in Computer science from PES University, Bangalore, India.
